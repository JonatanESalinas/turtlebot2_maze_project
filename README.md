# turtlebot2_maze_project

This is a program that helps a Turtlebot2 get out of a maze, making use of the LaserScan readings. This program is my implementation-solution to the final project of the ROS in 5 days course from Robot Ignite Academy.

With the command "roslaunch my_turtlebot_main my_turtlebot_main.launch" the whole program could be launched.

This repository contains the my_turtlebot_main and my_turtlebot_actions ROS packages. In the my_turtlebot_main package, there are all the files of the program and the launch files. In the my_turtlebot_actions package, there is an action folder with the definition of a custom message, used in the program.
